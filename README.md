# Dot-Com-Kill-Game
Command line interface game created by following the Head First Java 2nd edition book

3 domain domains are created & randomly placed diagnally or horizontally on a 7x7 grid at startup. Each cell name in the grid is represented by letter then number (ie. A3).
Each domain takes up 3 cell spaces & a user enters a cell name in the CLI as a guess.
Either 'hit', 'miss' or 'kill' will be a response after each user guess.
After all domains are killed, the number of user guess will be displayed & a score on the user's performance. 

hit = a correct cell name was entered, which corresponds to part of a domain
miss = incorrect cell name entered & no domain part is present in this cell
kill = all 3 parts of domain were correctly guessed & the domain is successfully killed
